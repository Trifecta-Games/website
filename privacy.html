      <p>Trafecta Studios ("we", "us", "our") operates mobile games and this website. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and protect personal information.</p>

      <h2>Information we collect</h2>
      <p>We may collect:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Information you provide (e.g., email when you contact us).</li>
        <li>Usage data (game analytics, crash reports, in-app events).</li>
        <li>Device and advertising identifiers (for analytics and ad personalization).</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>How we use information</h2>
      <p>We use information to operate and improve our games and website, to provide support, and to analyze usage. We may also use data for fraud prevention, and to comply with legal obligations.</p>

      <h2>Third parties</h2>
      <p>We may share data with service providers such as analytics platforms, crash-reporting services, hosting providers, and advertising partners. We do not sell personal information.</p>

      <h2>Ads</h2>
      <p>If our games display ads, ad partners may use device identifiers and other non-personal information to show relevant ads. Ad networks may have their own privacy policies.</p>

      <h2>Security</h2>
      <p>We take reasonable measures to protect information, but no method of transmission or storage is 100% secure.</p>

      <h2>Children</h2>
      <p>Our services are not intended for children under 13. If you believe we have collected personal data of a child under 13, contact us and we will take steps to remove it.</p>

      <h2>Your choices</h2>
      <p>You can opt out of certain analytics and ad personalization by using device settings or platform opt-outs. To request deletion or access to personal data, contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@trafectastudios.com">privacy@trafectastudios.com</a>.</p>

      <h2>Changes</h2>
      <p>We may update this policy. We will post the new policy on this page with a revised effective date.</p>
